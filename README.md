# potato-customer-segmentation
his is a README file for a Python script that analyzes customer purchase data. The script performs the following tasks:

Merges two datasets: a transaction dataset and a customer dataset
Filters the merged dataset for products containing the words "chip" and "chips" in the product name
Removes all special characters from the product name column
Splits the product name strings into a list of words
Groups the data by customer membership and calculates the total sales for each group
Groups the data by product name and quantity and calculates the number of times each product combination is purchased
Plots the time series data of total sales over time
Groups the data by customer lifestage, membership, and product name and calculates the total sales for each group
The script outputs the following:

A bar chart showing the total sales for each customer membership group
A bar plot showing the top 10 most purchased product combinations
A line chart showing the total sales over time
A CSV file containing the customer segmentation data
This script can be used to understand customer purchase behavior and develop targeted marketing strategies. For example, the script can be used to identify the most profitable customer groups, the most popular products, and the products that are most often purchased together. This information can then be used to create more effective marketing campaigns and increase sales.


Customer segmentation according to revenue, membership, and lifestage is an important step in understanding your customers and developing targeted marketing strategies.

Data preparation
First, you need to prepare your data. This includes merging the two datasets, filtering the DataFrame by the words "chip" and "chips" in the "PROD_NAME" column, removing all special characters from the "PROD_NAME" column, and splitting the strings into a list of words.

Data analysis
Once your data is prepared, you can begin to analyze it. One way to do this is to group the data by customer membership and calculate the total sales for each group. This will give you an idea of how much each group is spending.

Another way to analyze the data is to group it by product name and quantity. This will give you an idea of which products are most popular and how often they are purchased together.

Customer segmentation
Once you have analyzed the data, you can begin to segment your customers. One way to do this is to group them by revenue, membership, and lifestage. This will allow you to identify your most profitable customers, your most loyal customers, and your customers who are most likely to churn.

Data visualization
Data visualization can be a helpful tool for understanding your customer segmentation. For example, you can create a bar chart showing the total sales for each customer membership group or a line chart showing the total sales over time.

Conclusion
Customer segmentation according to revenue, membership, and lifestage is a powerful tool for understanding your customers and developing targeted marketing strategies. By understanding your customers' needs and behavior, you can create more effective marketing campaigns and increase your sales
